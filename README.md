Brunante: a theme for Brackets
==============================

This dark theme is inspired by Sublime Text's Twilight theme.  The screenshot 
illustrates how selected text is indicated using a dotted border.

It is not yet complete as it does not style all possible elements, which can
be seen in Pawel's bare Brackets theme [here](https://github.com/trimek/BearTheme/blob/master/BearTheme.css).<br/>


Let me know (andre.roberge@gmail.com) if you find some useful modifications or 
additions to this theme.
